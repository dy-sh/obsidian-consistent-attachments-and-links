// Keeps the in-repo `demo-vault/` in sync with the plugin's public surface WITHOUT
// launching Obsidian: it reflects the real config from source and asserts every
// setting is documented in a note, and that the guard note/member still exist
// (rename drift). This plugin's feature surface is a set of file-operation reactions
// and commands with no public API interface, so only the PluginSettings config class
// is reflected; the plugin's runtime behavior is covered by the other tests.
